# team worktree

Creates and removes a task worktree: a second checkout of the project on a branch of its own, where
one seat does one task. `new` cuts the branch from `workspace.base`, records the worktree in the
session's state and prints its folder; `remove` deletes a worktree that holds nothing that would be
lost, and keeps its branch.

## Synopsis

    team worktree new <task> [--kind <kind>] [--seat <name>] [--session <name>] [--file <path>]
    team worktree remove <task> [--session <name>] [--file <path>]

    Ignored files in the worktree are deleted with it.

## What it reads and writes

Reads the team file and this machine's approval store, the session's state
(`.agents/team.state.json`), and git: the base branch, the branch names, and the worktree itself.
With `--session`, the state of that session instead of `team.session`.

Every value the two subcommands read from the file is the **approved copy's** while a verified
approval is in force, whatever the file says now and whether or not the fingerprints match:
`workspace` (mode, path, branch, base, setup and limit), `trust`, the caller rules (`coordinator`
and `operator`), the session, the names a public project forbids, and the seats `--seat` may name.
An unapproved edit — a path moved, a setup command added, a trust pattern widened or narrowed, the
coordinator or the operator changed, a seat added, removed, renamed or redefined — is never used.
A seat taken out of the file is still one until the owner approves that.

`project` is read from the file as it is now, not from the approved copy. It is not an owner
section, so renaming it needs no approval. `{repo}` in `workspace.path` is that current name, which
decides the folder `new` creates and the directory `workspace.setup` runs in.
It does not place a worktree outside the approved trust: the landing is still judged against the
approved `trust` patterns, and a landing outside them is refused before anything is created. A
rename that puts `{repo}` outside the file's own trust patterns makes the file invalid, so the
command never starts. A pattern wide enough to cover the new name (for example `../worktrees/*`)
keeps the new folder inside the approved trust.

When an owner section or a seat was added, removed or changed, the command prints one note on
stderr before its normal output and before a later refusal (the trust, the limit, an unapproved
seat):

    team worktree: using the approved workspace settings; the file has unapproved changes: run `team approve`

The exit code is the one the run itself has. The log line is unchanged: the note is not written to
`team.log`. A caller the approved copy does not allow is refused before the note, and nothing is
created. `project` itself is not this drift: a file that sets `session` and changes only `project`
prints no note. When `session` is omitted it defaults to the project name, so a rename changes the
session too. That session change is the drift, the note prints, and state is written under the
approved session while `{repo}` is still the live name.

`--seat` is checked against the approved seats. The live seat list is read for one distinction: a
name the file declares and the approved copy does not gets `seat <name> is not in the approved
file`; a name neither declares gets `--seat "<name>" names no declared seat`.

A verified record whose stored copy this version cannot read — empty, invalid, or otherwise — refuses
with `the approved copy can't be read`, whether or not the fingerprints match. A record whose `file`
is not a string never becomes a verified standing. The store refuses it first, and the command
prints that line unchanged: `the approval record cannot be read (... "file" is not a string): run
team approve once`.

Writes `.agents/team.log`, `.agents/team.state.json` (one record under the session: the folder, the
branch, the seat when `--seat` names one, and whether `workspace.setup` succeeded), and, with `new`,
the worktree itself and the branch it cuts.

The folder is `workspace.path` with `{repo}` and `{task}` filled; the branch is `workspace.branch`
with `{kind}` and `{task}` filled. `new` fetches the base's upstream when it has one, and starts from
the local base, with a note in the log, when it doesn't. Nothing is created when the fetch fails.

## Who may run it

The owner, the coordinator's seat, and the operator's seat. The seat is that name's, in a session
this project's state records — the file's session, or one the state records the caller's pane in —
on the pane the state records for that name in that session: a seat of another session, or a pane
merely renamed to the coordinator's or the operator's name, is refused — and so is a seat the state
records no pane for, or records on another pane than this call is on; those two refusals name the
seat and the repair. What that proves is placement, and no more: the state file is in the project,
and a process of the same user that writes its own pane there under the coordinator's name, and
renames its pane, passes. The check guards a mistaken agent, not a hostile process running as the
same user.
`--file` and `--session` are the owner's alone, from a terminal outside herdr.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<task>` | one path segment: letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, starting with a letter or a digit |
| `--kind <kind>` | fills `{kind}` in `workspace.branch`; required when the pattern holds it, refused when it doesn't |
| `--seat <name>` | records a declared seat in the worktree's record |
| `--session <name>` | the session whose state is read and written, instead of `team.session`; the owner's alone |
| `--file <path>` | the team file, instead of `.agents/team.yaml`; the owner's alone |
| `--help`, `-h` | the usage, and exit 0 |

`remove` takes no `--kind` and no `--seat`.

When `setup` fails, the folder is still printed on stdout before the refusal: the worktree is kept,
recorded as `setup: failed`, and the exit code is 1.

## Exit codes

- `0` — the worktree was created, or removed; its folder, or what was removed, is printed on stdout.
- `1` — refused: a rule above, whatever the caller, the file, the name or git says.
- `2` — the invocation or the team file can't be read.

## Examples

```yaml file=.agents/team.yaml
format: 1
project: beacon
coordinator: claude-keeper
operator: claude-keeper

trust:
  - ~/.config/team/lobby
  - ~/Code/beacon
  - ~/Code/worktrees/beacon

workspace:
  mode: worktree
  path: ../worktrees/{repo}/{task}
  branch: "{kind}/{task}"
  base: main

seats:
  - role: coordinator
    name: claude-keeper
    label: coordinator
    cli: claude-code
    vendor: anthropic
    model: Claude Opus
    version: "5.5"
    launch: claude --model claude-opus-5-5

  - role: implementer
    name: claude-beacon
    label: implementer
    cli: claude-code
    vendor: anthropic
    model: Claude Opus
    version: "5.5"
    launch: claude --model claude-opus-5-5
```

The project has a `main` for the branches to start from:

```commit
Sketch the layout
```

A seat that isn't the coordinator or the operator can't create one:

```console caller=claude-beacon
$ team worktree new select-width --kind fix ; echo "exit $?"
team worktree: only the owner, the coordinator or the operator runs it; this call is claude-beacon
exit 1
```

The branch pattern asks for a kind, so the command does:

```console
$ team worktree new select-width ; echo "exit $?"
team worktree: --kind is required: the branch pattern is "{kind}/{task}"
exit 1
```

The task name is one path segment, and nothing else:

```console
$ team worktree new "select width" --kind fix ; echo "exit $?"
team worktree: a task name is one segment of letters, digits, ".", "_" and "-", and it starts with a letter or a digit
exit 1
```

A good one creates the worktree and prints where it is:

```console
$ team worktree new select-width --kind fix
../worktrees/beacon/select-width
```

The same task can't be open twice:

```console
$ team worktree new select-width --kind fix ; echo "exit $?"
team worktree: "select-width" is already recorded
exit 1
```

A commit that lives only in the worktree keeps it in place:

```git
-C ../worktrees/beacon/select-width commit --allow-empty -m "Measure the pane"
```

```console
$ team worktree remove select-width ; echo "exit $?"
team worktree: commits on no remote branch:
  <sha> Measure the pane
exit 1
```

A worktree with nothing to lose goes, and its branch stays:

```console
$ team worktree new tidy-logs --kind chore
../worktrees/beacon/tidy-logs
```

```console
$ team worktree remove tidy-logs
removed tidy-logs; the branch chore/tidy-logs is kept
```

An edit to an owner-controlled value is not in effect until the owner approves it. Here the file has been changed
to `mode: shared` and a seat has been added, neither approved; the command says so once, and goes
on with the approved workspace:

```yaml file=.agents/team.yaml
format: 1
project: beacon
coordinator: claude-keeper
operator: claude-keeper

trust:
  - .
  - ../worktrees/beacon/*

workspace:
  mode: shared

seats:
  - role: coordinator
    name: claude-keeper
    label: coordinator
    cli: claude-code
    vendor: anthropic
    model: Claude Opus
    version: "5.5"
    launch: claude --model claude-opus-5-5

  - role: implementer
    name: claude-beacon
    label: implementer
    cli: claude-code
    vendor: anthropic
    model: Claude Opus
    version: "5.5"
    launch: claude --model claude-opus-5-5

  - role: implementer
    name: claude-later
    label: later
    cli: claude-code
    vendor: anthropic
    model: Claude Opus
    version: "5.5"
    launch: claude --model claude-opus-5-5
```

```console
$ team worktree new read-back --kind fix ; echo "exit $?"
team worktree: using the approved workspace settings; the file has unapproved changes: run `team approve`
../worktrees/beacon/read-back
exit 0
```

The seat the file added is refused, because the approved copy doesn't declare it:

```console
$ team worktree new later-task --kind fix --seat claude-later ; echo "exit $?"
team worktree: using the approved workspace settings; the file has unapproved changes: run `team approve`
team worktree: seat claude-later is not in the approved file: run `team approve`
exit 1
```

# team issues

Lists the typed records in the one file the team file names. Anyone in the checkout may run it.
It reads. It writes nothing, and it creates no key.

The source is a file the owner committed. A broker source is read by `team next`, never from
here: this command connects to no broker, holds no tracker credential, and has no seat gate.
The broker runs as the same OS principal as the seat: that is integrity, not authenticity, and
this command does not isolate anything.
`title` and `description` are the owner's text. They are not scrubbed.
The list is file order. A priority is shown and does not reorder.
A listing is not a claim and not the intake rule. `team plan` prints the takeable queue and claims nothing.
`repos` and `needs` are shown when the file has them. They are not a grant, and they are not checked.
The watch's ring is unchanged: `Team: run team messages`.

## Synopsis

    team issues

## What it reads and writes

Reads the git checkout (`findRoot`), the team file, and the YAML list at `tasks.path`. The path
is relative to the checkout. A record's `id` and `title` are required. Every other field is
printed only when the file has it. An empty `blocked-by`, `repos`, or `needs` prints no line.

On a broker source nothing is listed and no socket connection is attempted: the refusal below
names where the read lives.

Writes nothing.

## Who may run it

Anyone in the checkout.

## Refusals

```text
team issues: the team file declares no task source
team issues: tasks.source must be file
team issues: team issues lists the file the owner committed; a broker source is read by team next
team issues: tasks.linear.project is required
team issues: the task file is not there
team issues: the task file is not a list
team issues: m1 is not a task: title is required
team issues: record 1 is not a task: id is required
team issues: nothing is waiting
```

`nothing is waiting` is not a refusal. It is what an empty list prints, and the exit is 0.

`tasks.source must be file` is the local-adapter miss: it stands for a source this build does not
carry. The broker-source sentence is the other side of the same rule — a tracker's records are
read behind the broker's socket, where the seat gate and the policy live, and this command has
neither.

## Exit codes

- `0` — the records were listed, or the list was empty.
- `1` — the team file can't be read, it declares no task source or one that is a broker's, the task file is missing or not a list, or a record is not a task.
- `2` — the invocation can't be read, or this folder is not a git checkout.

# team init

Writes the team file: a skeleton for this project, or the copy of `.agents/team.yaml` you last
approved on this machine. It also lists the team file and its runtime files in `.git/info/exclude`,
so git never sees them and a fresh clone never carries them.

## Synopsis

    team init [--restore]

## What it reads and writes

Reads the git repository (`findRoot`, `HEAD`, the git common directory) and, with `--restore`, the
user-level store (`~/.config/team/<project>-<hash>/approved.yaml`).

Writes `.agents/team.yaml`, adds the missing lines to `<git common dir>/info/exclude`, and appends
one line to `.agents/team.log`:

    .agents/team.yaml
    .agents/team.state.json
    .agents/team.log*
    .agents/team.lock
    .agents/seat-locks
    .agents/messages/

The skeleton is validated before it is written. Its `trust:` block names the machine lobby and this checkout:

    trust:
      - ~/.config/team/lobby
      - <the project root, as an absolute path>

An entry names a folder of the team's own; it is never a folder that contains the project, the home, or `team`'s own folders.

A file that already exists is never overwritten,
and no history is ever rewritten. The skeleton begins with a `# yaml-language-server: $schema=…` line so editors validate it against the package schema in `schema/team.schema.json`.
That line names the schema of the release that wrote the file — the tag `v` plus the version
`team --version` prints — so it never follows a moving branch.

## Who may run it

The owner, from a terminal outside herdr. A seat, an agent-run CLI, or a command without a terminal
is refused.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--restore` | write the copy of the team file this machine last approved, instead of a skeleton |
| `--help`, `-h` | the usage, and exit 0 |

## Refusals

| Message | Exit |
| --- | --- |
| `team init: only the owner runs init, from a terminal outside herdr; this call is <caller>` | 1 |
| `team init: not inside a git repository` | 2 |
| `team init: .agents/team.yaml is tracked by git, and a team file is private. Untrack it, keeping the file:` … | 1 |
| `team init: .agents/team.yaml exists already; it is left as it is. Its lines in .git/info/exclude were checked, and added where missing.` | 1 |
| `team init: nothing to restore: no team file was approved for this folder on this machine. Run team init for a skeleton.` | 1 |
| `team init: nothing was restored: the record for this folder was approved before records were signed: run `team approve` once.` — the record was written by an earlier `team`; the same shape, with the case, for a record that does not verify | 1 |
| `team init: unknown option --<name>` (with the usage) | 2 |

The tracked-file message names the repair:

    team init: .agents/team.yaml is tracked by git, and a team file is private. Untrack it, keeping the file:
      git rm --cached .agents/team.yaml
    then run team init again. History is not rewritten.

## Exit codes

- `0` — a skeleton was written, or the approved copy was restored.
- `1` — refused: not the owner, the file is tracked or already there, or there is nothing to restore.
- `2` — it can't run: not inside a git repository, or a bad option.

## Examples

A seat can't run it:

```console caller=agent
$ team init ; echo "exit $?"
team init: only the owner runs init, from a terminal outside herdr; this call is unplaced (it is run by an agent (claude) outside herdr)
exit 1
```

With nothing approved on this machine yet, `--restore` has nothing to bring back:

```console
$ team init --restore ; echo "exit $?"
team init: nothing to restore: no team file was approved for this folder on this machine. Run team init for a skeleton.
exit 1
```

A fresh clone gets a skeleton, with the head commit in a comment so `check` can read a history the
team file knows nothing about yet:

```console
$ team init
Wrote .agents/team.yaml: a skeleton with one seat. Edit it, then run team approve.

The team file is private to this clone: it is listed in .git/info/exclude, never in .gitignore,
so git doesn't see it and a fresh clone doesn't carry it. A collaborator writes their own, or
receives one and approves it themselves.
```

Running it again never touches the file:

```console
$ team init ; echo "exit $?"
team init: .agents/team.yaml exists already; it is left as it is. Its lines in .git/info/exclude were checked, and added where missing.
exit 1
```

A team file that git tracks is refused, because the file is the clone's, not the repository's:

```git
add -f .agents/team.yaml
```

```commit
Add the team file
```

```console
$ team init ; echo "exit $?"
team init: .agents/team.yaml is tracked by git, and a team file is private. Untrack it, keeping the file:
  git rm --cached .agents/team.yaml
then run team init again. History is not rewritten.
exit 1
```

# team pr check

Checks one pull request body against the team file's rules: the body must end with the signature
the file's `pullRequests` rule writes, and no line may match a forbidden pattern. It checks the
body alone, so it needs no repository at all — a project without git can check a request to merge.
The commits are a separate run, [`team commits check`](commits.md).

## Synopsis

    team pr check <file> [--file <path>]

## What it reads and writes

Reads the team file (or the one `--file` names), the ledger of this machine's store, and the file
holding the body (`-` reads standard input). It writes nothing, and it runs no git command: the
folder it runs in needs no repository.

## Who may run it

Anyone. It needs no herdr session, no terminal and no approval of its own; CI runs it on a push,
with the body written to a file or piped in with `-`.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<file>` | the pull request's body; `-` reads standard input |
| `--file <path>` | the team file, instead of `.agents/team.yaml` |
| `--help`, `-h` | the usage, and exit 0 |

## What it finds

The body is printed as one section, its findings under it:

    pull request body
      line 5: forbidden pattern ^Claude-Session:

| Finding | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `no signature: expected "**Agent:** {display} · {role}" in the last line` | the body carries no signature on its last line |
| `forbidden pattern <source>` | the line matches one of the file's patterns, or one of the two defaults |

The closing line says `team pr check: 1 pull request body checked: ok`, or
`…: the pull request body refused`.

## Refusals

| Message | Exit |
| --- | --- |
| `team pr check: a <file> is required` (with the usage) | 2 |
| `team pr check: one <file> at most` (with the usage) | 2 |
| `team pr check: unknown option --<name>` (with the usage) | 2 |
| `team pr check: <path>, line <n>: <message>` | 2 |
| `team pr check: can't read the pull request body: <error>` | 2 |

The old spelling `team check … --pr <file>` still runs this body check, one notice line first:
[`team check`](check.md).

## Exit codes

- `0` — the body passes.
- `1` — the body was refused.
- `2` — the check can't run: a bad invocation, a team file that can't be read, or a body file that can't be read.

## Examples

```yaml file=.agents/team.yaml
format: 1
project: beacon
coordinator: claude-keeper
operator: claude-keeper

identity:
  humans: [jane@acme.example]

trust:
  - ~/.config/team/lobby
  - ~/Code/beacon

workspace:
  mode: shared

seats:
  - role: coordinator
    name: claude-keeper
    label: coordinator
    cli: claude-code
    vendor: anthropic
    model: Claude Opus
    version: "5.5"
    launch: claude --model claude-opus-5-5

  - role: implementer
    name: claude-beacon
    label: implementer
    cli: claude-code
    vendor: anthropic
    model: Claude Opus
    version: "5.5"
    launch: claude --model claude-opus-5-5
```

A pull request's body signs on its last line:

```file file=pr.md
The metrics page is ready for review.

**Agent:** Claude Opus 5.5 · implementer
```

```console
$ team pr check pr.md ; echo "exit $?"
team pr check: warning: line 3: `coordinator:` is now `leads: true` on the lead's seat, and is still read
team pr check: 1 pull request body checked: ok
exit 0
```

This one forgot the signature:

```file file=body.md
Bump the retry window to thirty seconds.

The old one timed out on the flaky test.
```

```console
$ team pr check body.md ; echo "exit $?"
team pr check: warning: line 3: `coordinator:` is now `leads: true` on the lead's seat, and is still read
pull request body
  no signature: expected "**Agent:** {display} · {role}" in the last line
team pr check: 1 pull request body checked: the pull request body refused
exit 1
```

And this one signs, but leaks the line the file forbids:

```file file=leak.md
Tidy the logs.

The reader printed one line too many.

Claude-Session: 8f21c4a9
**Agent:** Claude Opus 5.5 · implementer
```

```console
$ team pr check leak.md ; echo "exit $?"
team pr check: warning: line 3: `coordinator:` is now `leads: true` on the lead's seat, and is still read
pull request body
  line 5: forbidden pattern ^Claude-Session:
    Claude-Session: 8f21c4a9
team pr check: 1 pull request body checked: the pull request body refused
exit 1
```

A body file that isn't there can't be read:

```console
$ team pr check missing.md ; echo "exit $?"
team pr check: warning: line 3: `coordinator:` is now `leads: true` on the lead's seat, and is still read
team pr check: can't read the pull request body: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './missing.md'
exit 2
```

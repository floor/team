# team remove

Takes one seat out of the team: asks it to exit, waits for its pane to come back to its shell,
closes its workspace, and edits the file so the seat is not started again. `--keep` leaves the seat
in the file as `stopped: true` instead of taking it out. A seat that is busy — working, blocked at a
prompt, already showing its own exit question, showing a screen the profile does not recognise,
or holding unsent text — is left as it is, unless its owner abandons it. A screen the profile does
not recognise is the one exception, for a caller other than the owner: the seat is taken out and
its pane is left running, with nothing typed into it (below). Every other seat, and the session,
are left alone.

## Synopsis

    team remove <name> [--keep] [--abandon] [--session <name>] [--file <path>]

## What it reads and writes

Reads the team file, the session's state (`.agents/team.state.json`, for a temporary seat's record),
herdr: whether the session runs, its agents, each pane's screen and status, and the pane's
foreground processes, which is how it knows the CLI has really exited, and the approval store:
stopping a seat and editing the file are changes the owner approves first. Without an approval in
force — never approved, a record from before records were signed, or one the verification refused —
nothing is stopped and nothing is written, with the one-line repair every command prints.

Writes the team file (the seat's entry taken out, or `stopped: true` added to it),
`.agents/team.state.json` (the seat's record is dropped), `.agents/team.log`, and, through herdr:
the exit typed into the pane, the wait for its shell, and the workspace closed — or, on the
unrecognised screen of a caller other than the owner, no typing and no close at all, and the
pane's agent renamed out of the seat's name, best effort. A temporary seat's
rules file goes with it, out of the project state folder; a seat left in the file as stopped keeps
its file for the next `up`. A file edit that
would not validate is refused before the seat is stopped, so a broken file never costs a live seat.

## Who may run it

The owner, the orchestrator's seat and the operator's seat. The seat is that name's, in a session
this project's state records — the file's session, or one the state records the caller's pane in —
on the pane the state records for that name in that session: a seat of another session, or a pane
merely renamed to the orchestrator's or the operator's name, is refused — and so is a seat the state
records no pane for, or records on another pane than this call is on; those two refusals name the
seat and the repair. What that proves is placement, and no more: the state file is in the project,
and a process of the same user that writes its own pane there under the orchestrator's name, and
renames its pane, passes. The check guards a mistaken agent, not a hostile process running as the
same user.
The
orchestrator's and the operator's own seats are the owner's alone to remove, and so is `--abandon`.
`--file` and `--session` are the owner's alone, from a terminal outside herdr: a non-owner aiming
either is refused before the flagged file or session is read at all.

A file with a `delegates` section also admits one more caller: the approved delegate, a pane the
owner named in that section as `<session>/<pane id>`, outside the team. When the ordinary rule
above refuses and the file names a delegate, the delegate gate decides — it re-reads the live file
and the approval in force, never a remembered copy — and a caller it passes runs this command as
that delegate. The delegated `remove` is the ordinary removal of a named seat: `--keep`, `--abandon`,
`--session` and `--file` stay the owner's, the orchestrator's and the operator's seats stay the
owner's, and a delegated remove never re-signs the approval — the one signing a `--keep` does is
closed to it. A `--file` or `--session` a non-owner aims is the gate's too, once the file names a
delegate: the gate refuses it before the flagged file or the flag's session is read, on the
eligibility of the default live file alone — the flagged file is never opened. With no `delegates`
section nothing changes: the same refusals, the same words, the same exit codes, those two flags'
included. A delegated run that proceeds is attributed in the log before its effects, as
`<time> delegate [delegate] <session>/<pane id> remove`.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--keep` | leave the seat in the file with `stopped: true`: `team up` leaves it out, and `team add <name>` starts it again |
| `--abandon` | the owner's: close the workspace of a seat that can't be asked, typing nothing into it |
| `--session <name>` | the herdr session, instead of `team.session`; the owner's alone |
| `--file <path>` | the team file, instead of `.agents/team.yaml`; the owner's alone |
| `--help`, `-h` | the usage, and exit 0 |

## What it prints

    claude-beacon: stopped
    removed claude-beacon

The seat's stop is the plan `down` prints for a seat, with its notes; the last line says what was
done with the file:

| Last line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `removed <name>` | the seat's entry was taken out of the file |
| `stopped <name>` | `--keep`: the entry stays, with `stopped: true` |
| `removed temporary <name>` | a temporary seat: it was never in the file |

A caller other than the owner that meets a screen the profile does not recognise takes the seat
out without asking it to leave: nothing is typed, the workspace is left open, the seat's state
record goes, and the pane's agent is renamed — best effort, one call — to `<name>-left`, or
`-left-2` and so on when that name is held, so it no longer answers the seat's name. The last
line names the pane:

    removed <name> (its pane <pane> was left running; nothing was typed; it now reads as <name>-left)

`--keep` marks the entry stopped instead, in the same parenthesised line. When the rename does
not take, the removal stands and the last line ends `it still carries the seat's name`. The
leftover pane is the owner's to close — team never closes it, since that close is `--abandon`
and it is no longer a seat — and the watch reports it as an agent that is running and is not in
the file.

A seat that doesn't leave cleanly is printed once with what stopped it, and `remove` exits 1:
`<seat>: its exit was not typed; left as it is (team remove <seat> --abandon closes it)`,
`<seat>: its exit was not confirmed; <what happened>; left running (team remove <seat> --abandon closes it)`
— the pane never drew the typed text, its box held other text, or the clearing key did not take —
`<seat>: timed out leaving its pane; left as it is (team remove <seat> --abandon closes it)`,
`<seat>: its workspace did not close`. The file is then not edited: the seat is still in the team.
With `--abandon`, that same seat's workspace is closed in the run and the line says so, and the
removal goes on.

A box that holds exactly this CLI's exit text — an earlier run typed it and never confirmed it — is
not the owner's text: when the profile carries the one key that empties a box, the text is cleared
with it inside the stop and the exit typed fresh, and when it does not, the seat is left as it is
with the text named, in the refusal below.

## Refusals

| ``team remove: delegation needs a verified approval: <reason>`` / ``team remove: delegation needs a readable approved copy: run `team approve` `` / ``team remove: delegation needs the approved file: the file is not the approved one (<differences>): run `team approve` `` — the delegate gate, reading the same approval every other check reads | 1 |
| ``team remove: delegation cannot verify its placement or seats: <reason>`` | 1 |
| `team remove: the approved delegate must be an external non-seat pane` | 1 |
| ``team remove: the approved delegate <session>/<pane id> may not run `remove`; its approved commands are <list>`` | 1 |
| `team remove: --<flag> is the owner's; the approved delegate cannot use it` — `--keep`, `--abandon`, `--session` or `--file` | 1 |

| `team remove: --session is the owner's, from a terminal outside herdr; this call is <caller>` | 1 |

| ``team remove: another session-mutating run is holding session <session> (pid <pid>); try again when it is done`` — another run holds the session's mutator lock, the one lock `up`, `add`, `down` and `remove` share; the line names no command, because the lock is shared. The lock is taken before this run's first effect and released at its end; every refusal above is decided first and never shows it | 1 |
| ``team remove: another session-mutating run may be holding session <session>, and its lock cannot be read; if no run is using it, delete <state dir>/seat-locks/<session>/.run`` — the lock file does not read as a token, so its holder is unknown and only the owner clears it; the line names the file | 1 |

`--abandon` answers the seat-state refusals above — a seat that is working, blocked at a prompt,
sitting at its own exit question, on a screen the profile does not recognise, holding unsent
text, or holding this CLI's exit text unsent: the seat is not asked anything, its workspace is
closed as it is, and its pane's text is lost.

## Exit codes

- `0` — the seat was stopped or was not running, or the unrecognised-screen leave above took it
  out with its pane left running; and the file was edited.
- `1` — the run was refused, or the seat was left behind with the file untouched.
- `2` — the invocation, the team file or the state can't be read, or the edit would not validate.

## Examples

  - ~/.config/team/lobby
  - ~/Code/beacon

```

```fixture
agents: all
```

A seat mid-turn is not interrupted — its work would be lost — and `remove` says which state it was
in:

```console screens="claude-beacon=working"
$ team remove claude-beacon ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: claude-beacon is working; left as it is
exit 1
```

A permission prompt is the same: `team` never answers one, so it never closes a seat that waits at
one.

```console screens="claude-beacon=permission"
$ team remove claude-beacon ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: claude-beacon is blocked at a prompt, which team never answers
exit 1
```

A screen the profile can't read never frees itself, and only the owner may abandon it, so the
owner's refusal names that way out:

```console screens="claude-beacon=unknown"
$ team remove claude-beacon ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: claude-beacon shows a screen the profile does not recognise; left as it is (team remove claude-beacon --abandon closes its workspace without typing)
exit 1
```

Anyone else — the orchestrator, the operator, or the approved delegate — takes the seat out and
leaves the pane as it is instead; the example below shows that removal.

An implementer's seat may not remove anything — not even itself:

```console caller=claude-beacon
$ team remove claude-beacon ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: only the owner, the orchestrator or the operator runs it; this call is claude-beacon
exit 1
```

The orchestrator's seat may remove others, never itself, and `--abandon` is the owner's own, from a
terminal outside herdr:

```console caller=claude-keeper
$ team remove claude-keeper ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: only the owner removes the orchestrator's or the operator's seat; this call is claude-keeper
exit 1
$ team remove claude-beacon --abandon ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: only the owner abandons a seat, from a terminal outside herdr
exit 1
```

A temporary seat is recorded in the state, not in the file, so it is removed by the name `add` gave
it — and `--keep` has nothing to keep. It comes before the seats the file declares change: taking a
seat out of the file moves the `limits` the file defaults to, and `add --temporary` refuses a file
that is no longer the approved one.

```console
$ team add --temporary --like claude-beacon --until result:notes/result.md ; echo "exit $?"
claude-beacon-tmp-1: ready
exit 0
$ team remove claude-beacon-tmp-1 --keep ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: a temporary seat is not in the file; there is nothing to keep
exit 1
$ team remove claude-beacon-tmp-1 ; echo "exit $?"
claude-beacon-tmp-1: stopped
removed temporary claude-beacon-tmp-1
exit 0
```

`--keep` stops the seat and leaves its place in the file, for a seat that will come back:

```console
$ team remove claude-beacon --keep ; echo "exit $?"
claude-beacon: stopped
stopped claude-beacon
exit 0
$ team add claude-beacon ; echo "exit $?"
claude-beacon: ready
exit 0
```

A caller other than the owner that meets a screen the profile does not recognise takes the seat
out and leaves the pane as it is: nothing is typed, the workspace stays open, and the pane's agent
is renamed so it no longer answers the seat's name (`--keep` leaves the entry stopped, with the
same parenthesised line):

```console caller=claude-keeper screens="claude-reviewer=unknown"
$ team remove claude-reviewer ; echo "exit $?"
removed claude-reviewer (its pane w3:p1 was left running; nothing was typed; it now reads as claude-reviewer-left)
exit 0
```

Without `--keep` the seat's entry goes with it, and a second `remove` has nothing to find:

```console
$ team remove claude-beacon ; echo "exit $?"
claude-beacon: stopped
removed claude-beacon
exit 0
$ team remove claude-beacon ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: the team has no seat "claude-beacon"
exit 1
```

A name is required, and its absence stops at the usage line before the file is read:

```console
$ team remove ; echo "exit $?"
team remove: a seat name is required
Usage: team remove <name> [--keep] [--abandon] [--session <name>] [--file <path>]
exit 2
```

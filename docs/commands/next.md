# team next

Claims one record from the file the team file names, and holds it with a lease in this clone.
A seat cannot pull until `team up` has recorded its pane.

The source is a file the owner committed, or a tracker the owner's broker reads. On a broker
source, `team next` asks the broker; with no broker running it refuses and claims nothing. The
broker holds the tracker credential; this command never reads it.
The broker runs as the same OS principal as the seat: that is integrity, not authenticity, and
this command does not isolate anything.
A lease is a file in this clone. Two live leases in this clone do not cover one id. Another
clone, and another machine, are outside that promise.
An expired lease returns the record to the queue. Another seat may take it, and the work may
be done twice.
The file is the intake for a file source. A record is takeable because the owner wrote it there.
For a broker source the intake is the tracker's read, with the team's policy deciding which
fields cross. That is not the owner-set intake rule. `team plan` is not a command.
`title` and `description` are the owner's text. They are not scrubbed. A broker source's policy
may keep a field from crossing, and a field left out is absent from the record, never blank.
A record with `blocked-by`, `repos`, or `needs` is listed by `team issues` and is not taken.
A deadline is printed and not read as a time. A missed deadline is not decided here.
Releasing a lease records no progress.
The watch's ring is unchanged: `Team: run team messages`.

## Synopsis

    team next [--mine | --release]

## What it reads and writes

Reads the git checkout (`findRoot`), the team file, the YAML list at `tasks.path`, and the
lease files under `.agents/leases/` in this clone. The path is relative to the checkout. A
record's `id` and `title` are required. The printed block is the `team issues` block, one
record. No lease field is printed.

On a broker source it reads the same git checkout and team file, then asks the broker over
`.agents/broker.sock`: one request line carrying the caller's seat and pane, one answer line back,
with a five-second deadline. Nothing is read from the tracker directly, and the credential is
never read here. The seat gate runs first; the broker checks the same claim again on the request,
and its refusal — the same sentences — is what this command prints.

Writes one lease file, `.agents/leases/<id>.json`, or rewrites the caller's own live file.
The lease lasts 30 minutes. A re-run while it is live renews it and prints that record again.
It does not take a second id. `--release` unlinks the caller's file and records no progress.
An expired lease returns the record to the queue. On a broker source the lease is still the local
one: the tracker holds no claim, and `--release` unlinks the caller's file without reaching the
broker. `team next` does not edit `.git/info/exclude` and does not write the task file.

## Who may run it

A declared seat of this team, on the pane the state records for that seat. Any declared seat
may pull, not only the orchestrator. The owner is refused. A name that is not a seat is
refused the same way.

A team that has never been started has no recorded pane, so a seat cannot pull until `team up`
has recorded one:

```text
team next: no pane is recorded for seat <name> in this session: the owner stops that seat and runs `team up`
```

The wrong pane is refused with the pane the state records:

```text
team next: the state records pane <pane> for seat <name> in this session, not the pane this call is on: the owner stops the team and starts it again (`team down`, then `team up`)
```

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--mine` | a new take keeps only records whose `assignee` is the caller's seat name. It does not filter a renewal |
| `--release` | unlink the caller's lease and print `team next: released <id>`. Records no progress |
| `--help`, `-h` | the usage, and exit 0 |

`--mine` and `--release` together are refused, and no file is written.

## What it prints

One record, the issues block. Nothing else on stdout when a record was claimed.

`team next: nothing is takeable` when the takeable set is empty. That is one answer, not a
poll and not a stand-down.

`team next: nothing is assigned to you` when `--mine` has nothing to take.

`team next: nothing is held` when `--release` finds no file of the caller's.

`team next: released <id>` when the caller's file was unlinked.

`team next: the tracker holds more tasks than this read; the take still proceeds` on stderr when
the broker's answer says the tracker holds another page. The read is bounded, and it says so: the
take proceeds with the notice, never with a silent truncation.

## Refusals

```text
team next: only a seat of this team pulls a task; this call is owner
team next: no pane is recorded for seat <name> in this session: the owner stops that seat and runs `team up`
team next: the team file declares no task source
team next: tasks.source must be file
team next: tasks.path must stay inside the checkout
team next: the task file is not there
team next: the task file is not a list
team next: m1 is not a task: title is required
team next: --mine and --release are not used together
team next: the broker is not running; the owner starts it with `team broker`
team next: the broker's answer is not one this build knows; the owner restarts it
team next: the broker accepted the request and did not answer; nothing is claimed
team next: the broker failed this read
team next: tasks.policy.omit must not name id or title, the record itself
```

`tasks.source must be file` is the local-adapter miss: it stands for a file source whose adapter
this build does not carry. A broker source never prints it — it goes to the broker path.

The refusals between `the broker is not running` and `the broker failed this read` are the broker
path's, in order: no broker answered (or the answer was not one this build knows, or arrived past
the deadline), then the broker refused the read itself. The last is the validator on a broker
source's policy, the same sentence the broker prints at its own start.

A record that is not a task is named on stderr and is not a candidate. If another record is
claimed, the exit is still 0. If nothing is claimed and any record was refused, stdout has no
block and the exit is 1.

## Exit codes

- `0` — a record was claimed, the caller's live lease was renewed, a lease was released, or there was nothing to take or to release.
- `1` — the caller is not a seat of this team on its recorded pane, the team file can't be read or its policy is refused, the task file is missing or not a list, nothing was taken and a record is not a task, or the broker path refused: no broker answered, the broker's answer was not one this build knows, the deadline passed, the broker refused the caller, or the broker failed the read.
- `2` — the invocation can't be read, or this folder is not a git checkout.

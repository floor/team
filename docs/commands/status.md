# team status

Shows the team as it stands: one line per seat with what the session's herdr shows of it, and one
`difference` for each way the file, the state and the live session disagree. For a seat it changes
nothing. For the owner it records the last file that validated, so a later read can fall back to
that copy when the file breaks. It names the command that repairs each difference.

## Synopsis

    team status [--session <name>] [--file <path>] [--json]

## What it reads and writes

Reads the team file (or the one `--file` names), this machine's approval store, the session's state
(`.agents/team.state.json`), and herdr: the agents, their panes, their workspaces, and each pane's
visible text, from which the running model is read. It also reads the machine's own swap, for the
one check that can never pass here. It writes nothing but the `last_valid` copy of
the file it read — and a run that is not the owner's writes nothing at all.

## Who may run it

Anyone, in any terminal, and it needs no approval of its own. It does need herdr to answer: without
it, `status` can't say anything and exits 2. `--file` may be aimed by any caller — a plain folder's
project has no git walk to find the file, so its own seats carry the flag — and a run that is not
the owner's writes nothing at all, beside the file it read or in its own project.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--session <name>` | the herdr session to read, instead of `team.session` |
| `--file <path>` | the team file, instead of `.agents/team.yaml`; a run that is not the owner's writes nothing |
| `--json` | print the same reading as one JSON document instead of the table, the notes and the repairs |
| `--help`, `-h` | the usage, and exit 0 |

## Rows

    team beacon, session "beacon"
      claude-keeper  missing  Claude Opus 5.5  -
      claude-beacon  working  Claude Opus 5.5  w1:p1

The columns are the seat, its state, the model, and the pane. The state is what herdr says
(`idle`, `working`, `blocked`…), with `, parked` added for a seat the file parks and `, temporary`
for a temporary one; or `<state> (unsent text)` when an idle or done seat — the two states `team`
types into — holds text in its input box that was never sent; or `missing` when the seat is in the
file and nothing is running for it, or when the pane the state recorded for it runs no CLI — the
CLI ended, or the session was restored, and the pane is back at its shell; or `restored, not
launched by team` when its pane runs a process `team` did not launch — another session's restore,
or a CLI started by hand; or `stopped` when the file marks it stopped; or `wrong name`
when an agent sits in the seat's workspace under another name. A `wrong name` row's model is
the one that pane's screen names, or `(unread)` when the screen names none — never the file's.

A pane is its seat only while the process `team` launched is still in it. The state records, for
each seat `up` or `add` launched, the pane's own shell process and the processes the launch left in
front of it — pids only, never a command line. The reading is one `herdr pane process-info` of the
pane, taken once, after the idle prompt appears and after the launch model check: nothing is read
again after a first message. Wherever `status` reads the seat as running, the two are compared:
`same` is the pane team launched, `missing` a pane back at its shell, `restored, not launched by
team` a pane held by another process. The comparison is pids only, and it accepts the seat while
**any** recorded CLI pid is still in front: an extra pid beside them, or another order, changes
nothing. A restored row's model is `-`, never the file's: nothing checks what that process runs.
When that pane's screen names a model, a note names it — `<seat>: its pane runs <model> <version>; that process is not the one team launched` — and the note does not change the exit. A
seat with no `launched` record — a seat launched before this record existed, or one whose process
herdr could not read (the reading is taken once, after the seat's idle prompt; a seat stopped at a
dialog records it in the same write as its waiting record) — is shown as it always was;
`team doctor` says which seats those are.

The comparison is wrong in the safe direction, but it is wrong: a CLI that replaces its own process
— an updater that re-executes, a wrapper that hands over — changes the foreground pids, and the
seat then reads `restored, not launched by team` although nothing was restored and its conversation
is intact. `up` acts on that reading: it closes the pane without input and launches the seat fresh,
and the conversation in it is lost. No reading of a CLI after its first message was taken when this
record was made; a review's runs of a CLI that starts a helper beside itself and of one behind a
pipeline kept every pid in front, so all of them were recorded. Before running `up` over such a
row — `status` names the seat — the owner looks at the pane: it says whether the CLI there is the
one `team` launched, and `up`'s own guards are in `docs/commands/up.md`.

The model is the seat's `display` when the running model matches the file, and
`<model> <version> (file: <display>)` when it doesn't. A screen that doesn't show the model is a
`note` rather than a difference: `unread` is never wrong.

An approval in force is a note of its own, `approval #1 (2026-10-04), key fe21ef6293de`: the
signing's number, its date and the key's fingerprint — the first twelve hex digits of the key's
public half. An owner who noted the fingerprint sees a *replaced* key; a process that only reads
it changes nothing `team` shows, and `team` computes what it shows.

## Budgets

When the file names an account, or a reading is stored in the state, a `budgets:` table follows
the seats. One row per account and window: what is left and used, when it resets, which seat the
figure came from, how long since it changed, the source it was counted from, and whether it is
fresh, unconfirmed, stale, refusing, or unknown. A row's account is the seat's own: its `account:`
when the file names one, its `vendor` when it doesn't, so one vendor's two accounts are two rows.
A figure inside its reserve says so on that row, including when it is still fresh.
When the counted figure did not come from the first source the account names, the row names the
source it did come from and marks it: `status line (fallback)`.
An old figure with no known reset reads unknown while it could still matter — inside its reserve,
or within the reserve again outside it. Further out — more than the reserve again — it is still
shown, its when column saying `last seen 40m ago`: the room the figure last held.
A named account with no reading is unknown. The table is left out when there is nothing
to show. `status` records no reading; the watch is what records one.

An openai account can take its figure from a check instead of the status line. Copy
`examples/checks/codex-quota` onto `PATH` and name it as that account's `check`, with
`check` listed before `status_line` in `sources`. The script prints the primary
window from the newest local rollout that has a quota figure, opening ten files
at most, and a second line when that event's secondary window is a different
length. For example `weekly 39% used resets 114h4m at 1791091200`. `team`
passes only `PATH` and `HOME`, so `CODEX_HOME` never reaches the script. With a
custom Codex home, install a two-line wrapper that sets it and execs this script,
and name the wrapper as the check:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
CODEX_HOME=/path/to/codex exec /path/to/codex-quota
```

## Differences

A seat the state records waiting shows `waiting for owner (<classification>)` — or
`trust sent; recovery required` — as its row, with its pane, and its one difference stands before
the unnamed and launch-stopped ones. The classification is validated when the state is read,
against the closed list (`trust`, `permission`, `question`, `vendor notice`, `login`, `unknown`,
`unsent`, `timeout`): anything else the file holds reads `unknown` in the row, in the difference
and in the log line the record writes, so a hand-edited or corrupted file can never print its bytes
here.

| Difference | Repair |
| --- | --- |
| `<seat> is in the file and is not running` | `team add <seat>` when something else runs, `the owner runs team up` when nothing does |
| `<seat>: its pane runs no CLI (the CLI ended or the session was restored)` | `the owner runs team up` (it closes the pane without input and launches the seat fresh) |
| `<seat>: the process in its pane is not the one team launched; nothing checks its model, account or rules` | `the owner runs team up` (it closes the pane without input and launches the seat fresh) |
| `<seat>: the agent in <pane> is named "x"` | `herdr --session <s> agent rename <pane> <seat>` |
| `<seat> runs <model> <version>; the file says <declared>` (`<declared>` is the seat's `display` spelling) | restart it (`team remove <seat> --keep`, then `team add <seat>`), or correct the file and `team approve` |
| `<seat> is marked stopped in the file and is running` | `team remove <seat> --keep`, or take `stopped: true` off the seat |
| `<seat>: waiting for owner (<classification>)` | `the owner runs team up` (it offers to open the pane, skip the seat or stop cleanly), or `team answer <seat> trust` when the classification is `trust` and the policy is `dialogs.trust: orchestrator` |
| `<seat>: trust sent; recovery required` | `the owner runs team up` |
| `<seat>: its launch stopped at "<stage>"` | `the owner runs team up (it resumes the launch)` |
| `<seat>: its rules were not delivered` | `team remove <seat> --keep`, then `team add <seat>` |
| `<seat>: its rules file is missing` / `… is a symbolic link` / `… is not a regular file` / `… has mode 0644, not 0600` / `… is not owned by this user` / `… cannot be read` / `… differs from the approved rules` | `the owner runs team up` — the seat's rules travel in a file in the project state folder, and it no longer holds the approved rules text; `status` never rewrites it |
| `<seat> holds text in its input box that was never sent` | `the owner clears or sends it in the pane; team does not type into a box it can't verify` |
| `<seat>: its launch stopped at "named", and it holds text in its input box that was never sent` | `the owner clears or sends it in the pane, then runs team up (it resumes the launch)` |
| `<name>: a temporary seat is recorded and is not running` | `team remove <name>` |
| `no watch has run for this session` | `team watch --session <s>` |
| `the watch's last pass was <n> minute(s) ago` | `team watch --session <s>` |
| `an unnamed <cli> (w1:p2) is running and is not in the file` | add the seat to the file and `team approve`, or close it |
| `worktree <task>: its setup failed` | `team worktree remove <task>` |
| `the protected checkout "." is on "x", not on "main"` | `the owner switches it back: git -C . switch main` |
| `the file was never approved on this machine` | the owner runs `team approve` |
| `approved before records were signed: run `team approve` once`, or the case a refused record names | the owner runs `team approve` |
| `the file differs from the approved one: <line>` | the owner runs `team approve` |

The one precondition `status` knows and orders is the real one: the file is not the approved one.
That difference is printed first, and a repair that names a command that refuses on an unapproved
file — `team up`, `team add`, `team worktree` — is marked `(after: …)`. Nothing else is reordered
or marked: a missing or stale watch blocks no repair, and what blocks a launch is `team doctor`'s
to report. When at least one repair is the owner's, the summary line reports
`N difference(s), M for the owner`.

## The JSON

`--json` prints the same reading as one document, format 1:

    {
      "format": 1,
      "project": "beacon",
      "session": "beacon",
      "rows": [{ "name": "claude-keeper", "state": "missing", "model": "Claude Opus 5.5", "pane": "-" }],
      "notes": [],
      "differences": [{ "what": "claude-keeper is in the file and is not running", "repair": "team add claude-keeper" }],
      "notice": null
    }

`rows`, `notes` and `differences` hold what the table, the notes and the repairs hold; each seat in
`rows` has `name`, `state`, `model`, `pane`, and, when recorded at workspace creation by a migrated launch,
`start_cwd`. `notice` is the line a normal run prints above the table, or null when there is none. `budgets` is present only
when the budgets table would be printed, one object per row (`account`, `window`, `left`, `used`,
`resetsIn`, `seat`, `age`, `source`, `fallback`, `state`, `inside`, `reserve`). `inside` is true
when a subscription's left figure is at or inside its reserve, `fallback` when the figure did not
come from the first source the account names, and `reserve` the reserve that row was read against —
the same figure the table's line names, null when the account has none. The exit
code is the same as without `--json`, and the file's warnings still go to stderr.

## Refusals

| Message | Exit |
| --- | --- |
| `team status: unexpected "x"` (with the usage) | 2 |
| `team status: team.yaml line <n>: <message>` | 2 |
| `team status: herdr doesn't answer; is it installed and running?` | 2 |

A team file that loads with warnings prints them on stderr as
`team status: warning, line <n>: <message>` and goes on.

## Exit codes

- `0` — no difference: the file, the state and the live session agree.
- `1` — at least one difference; each is printed with its repair.
- `2` — the invocation or the team file can't be read, or herdr doesn't answer.

Only the implementer is up, so the orchestrator's seat is a difference with its repair. The state
also holds the watch's last readings for the `openai` account the file names: a check's `session`
window, a `daily` one from the status line last seen 40 minutes ago, and a `weekly` one the check
never reported — that one too comes from the status line, so its row marks it a fallback:

```console
$ team status ; echo "exit $?"
team status: warning, line 3: `coordinator:` is now `leads: true` on the lead's seat, and is still read

```

`--json` prints that reading as one document, for a script to read instead of the table:

```console

The repair is the command `add` starts a stopped or missing seat with:

```console
$ team add claude-keeper
claude-keeper: ready
```

Now nothing disagrees:

```console

The machine's own swap is read for one case only: the check in force — the 2GB default, or the
file's own `swap_free_min` — asks for more free swap than this machine has in total, so `up`
refuses on it here every time. The same fact `doctor` warns about is one note, above the approval
note, with both figures and the repair; `--json` carries it in `notes` in the same place:

```console machine="small-swap"

note: the machine check asks for 2.0 GB free swap, more than this machine has in total (1.0 GB): `team up` will refuse here; set `machine.swap_free_min` to a figure this machine can keep, then run `team approve`

```

A check that merely fails right now — the machine has the swap in total, and not enough of it
free at this moment — prints no note here: `up`'s refusal names it when the owner runs it, and
the watch reports what it reads. The total is read on macOS from `sysctl -n vm.swapusage`, and on
Linux from `/proc/meminfo`'s `SwapTotal`; a machine with no swap at all is not this case, and
nothing is said when the total can't be read.

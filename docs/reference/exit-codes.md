# Exit codes

Each row is one way a command ends. `0` means the work finished, `1` means the command refused or a step failed, and `2` means the invocation or a file could not be read. One `return` can be several rows when several different failures leave through it. A thrown error ends as `1`.

The check keeps this list complete against ordinary changes to the commands (a new return, a new exit, a changed code); it reads the forms this codebase uses and refuses anything else; it is not a proof against code written to deceive it (`eval`, a patched `process`, a dynamic property name). The gate catches mistakes in ordinary command code; it isn't proof against code written to evade it.

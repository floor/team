// The broker's serving half: bind the clone's one socket, check every request against the
// recorded state, dispatch the read, apply the policy, answer one line. The start protocol has
// three answers, pinned by the recon's probe under bun and node: a connect that succeeds means a
// broker already answers (refuse, the caller's exit is nonzero); ECONNREFUSED means a socket
// file left by an unclean death (unlink it — only when it is still the very entry the probe saw,
// and only once that entry has answered stale twice with a turn between — then bind); ENOENT
// means no file (bind). One lstat stands before all three: a path that is
// not a socket is refused up front — never probed, never unlinked (the ubuntu CI read that made
// this a pinned fork: run 37778336251). A clean
// close removes the file — the runtime owns that, pinned under bun 1.4.2 and node v26.8.1
// (afterBind true, afterClose false) — and a path that cannot bind is a refusal with a code,
// never a crash (a regular file at the path fails under both runtimes: EADDRINUSE under bun,
// EINVAL under node; an over-long path fails under node only — bun binds 207 bytes). The check is the S2 caller
// functions reused verbatim, against the claimed (seat, pane) and the recorded state: integrity
// against a mistaken agent, not authenticity against a hostile one (RFC 008 §5's same-principal
// limit; the page says so).
//
// The whole start section — the lstat gate, the probe, the clear, the bind, the listen — runs
// under one lock beside the socket (`.agents/broker.sock.lock`, never at the socket path
// itself), so two starts in two processes serialize instead of racing a path one of them is
// still on its way to binding (the pin: a real owner held pre-listen, a second real start
// spawned mid-hold — the owner serves, the second waits and reads it live). The serialization
// is between starts that leave the paths alone — a same-principal process that removes the
// lock or the socket path can still split two starts, which the page states. The lock file
// holds its holder's pid and carries `withLock`'s discipline from `src/state.ts` — an
// exclusive create that publishes the entry whole (a private temp naming its writer, linked
// into the shared name, so no reader ever sees the name without its pid), a lock whose holder
// is dead taken over, one start at a time through a claim beside the lock — written as an
// await loop because this section spans awaits, where `withLock`
// busy-waits; `withLock` itself is untouched. A start whose wait
// outlasts the deadline answers `locked`: refused, nothing cleared, nothing bound. The lock is
// released when the listen lands and on every other way out of the section.

 *  the very entry such a judgement landed on — the free window carried a second walker, and
 *  neither the restore-by-name nor a put-back that lost the name race closed it (measured on
 *  my own export of the head that introduced the discipline: six starts on a dead pid's lock
 *  breached 10/30 rounds, corpse + dead pid 13/60, and an aside-judging variant of this fix
 *  48/300 — every breach a `bind-failed` start that never waited). Here the claim's holder
 *  re-reads the entry and removes it only when it still names no live holder and is not still
 *  young — this build's own creates publish whole, so an entry still in that gap is a foreign
 *  or older writer's, and the window stays its charge — then drops the claim, and
 *  every start re-races the exclusive create, which arbitrates cleanly: one wins the create
 *  and holds, every other reads the winner live and takes the wait. A crashed claim-holder is
 *  recovered the way its locks are: a claim naming a dead pid, or an empty one aged out, is
 *  cleared by the next start — the eviction is idempotent, its follow-up the same create race
 *  — and the claim names its holder's pid, so an evicted-and-replaced claim is never mistaken
 *  for the one this start just wrote.
 *
 *  The round's invariant, on every unlink under this discipline: an unlink acts only on the
 *  entry its actor has established — existence taken first (an absent path is nothing to
 *  clear), identity checked (dev+ino, and the bytes still naming the pid that was read: a
 *  replacement is a different inode, and one that reuses the freed inode names its own
 *  writer) — and judging implies holding (the lock is removed only by a start whose claim is
 *  still its own at the moment of removal; a claim is released only against its create's own
 *  entry and pid). Refused by it: a stale eviction removing a rival's fresh claim, and a
 *  straddling judge removing the fresh lock a rival's removal-and-create landed — the two
 *  judges a stolen claim allows. The residual is one syscall pair wide — a compare→unlink gap

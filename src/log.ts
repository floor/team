// One line per change: when, which command, called by whom, what changed. Classifications only,
// never the text of a screen.
//
// The line is cleaned here, at the one sink every command logs through, with the same function
// the records' fields are cleaned with (`plainLine`): every caller's or reason's escape
// sequence, bidi override or other invisible format character is removed before it can reach
// the file, so every line of every command's log is clean by construction, whoever calls and
// whatever the text it was given — the terminals and the log agree by construction.
// For ordinary text nothing changes: the cleaning removes or folds characters, it never rewrites
// an ordinary word. A line feed, U+2028/U+2029 and any whitespace run fold to one space, exactly
// as they do in a record's field, so the log stays one `0a`-terminated line per change and holds
// the same words the record said.
//
// The log rotates at 1 MB and keeps three files.
//
// The log is evidence, never a decision: a write that fails — a full disk, a path that is not a
// file, a permission the owner kept — is caught and dropped here, at the one sink every command
// logs through, so no command's exit status and no watch pass depends on the log being writable.

// A seat that stopped at a dialog `team` may not answer, with its owner at the terminal.
//
// The pause is the whole of the interaction: it records the seat as waiting for its owner —
// with the process identity read at that moment, in the same write — draws the record, and asks
// with one exact line. `o` focuses the pane and never sends a key or a text into it: from there
// the owner works in her own pane, and this loop polls the screen until it reaches its prompt,
// stops at something else, or runs out the profile's idle timeout — then asks again. `s` closes
// the seat's workspace without input and clears its state. `q` and Ctrl-C stop cleanly: the
// caller (execute) closes what this invocation created and writes the stopped records.
//
// The seat lock is taken before each of resume, open, skip and close, and released before the
// prompt is shown: nothing holds the lock while the owner looks at the terminal or while a pane
// is polled. A pane is never typed into, and the workspace of a seat this run did not create is
// never closed.
//
// Under a `dialogs.trust` that names the lead the prompt is also re-read on a tick: `team answer`
// may be racing this run, so every timeout and every return takes the lock, reads the state and
// the pane fresh, and follows what it finds — a seat that became ready, a recovery `answer` left
// behind (which is shown and offers the same keys), or the screen's own reading. No trust key is
// ever sent from here.

// Reading one key from the owner's terminal.
//
// Raw mode is entered for one read and left the instant the read ends, so the terminal is never
// in raw mode between reads — during pane polls, focus changes, or any other work the pause does.
// Every exit from a read restores it: the key arriving, the timeout, end of input, a setup error,
// and, while a read is in flight, SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP. A signal restores the mode first,
// removes these handlers and re-raises the signal, so the process dies by the signal's own
// default action and never leaves the owner's terminal raw. In raw mode the line discipline is
// off, so a Ctrl-C arrives as the byte 0x03 rather than as SIGINT: that byte is read as `q`.
//
// One chunk is one key only when the chunk is exactly one byte of the four; anything else —
// several bytes that arrived together (a paste, a held key, a fast keystroke pair), an escape
// sequence, any other byte — reads as `other` and changes nothing. A chunk's first byte is never
// taken as its key: `sq` pasted at the prompt would otherwise stop the run. Type-ahead is
// discarded instead of answered: `drain()` reads and throws away every byte already pending, and
// the pause drains before every prompt. What remains possible on this runtime: bytes that have
// not reached Node's stream yet when `drain()` runs (the terminal's own buffer, or a paste
// arriving between the drain and the read) are still read by the next `key()`, where the
// one-chunk rule keeps a multi-byte paste from ever acting as a key; a trailing single byte of a
// paste split across two data events is the one byte that can still act, and it can only be `o`,
// `s`, `q` or Ctrl-C — the four the owner could have pressed.

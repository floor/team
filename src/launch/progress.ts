// One progress record per seat, and the writer that draws it.
//
// `up` and `add` work one seat at a time, and a seat's line is the run's whole account of it:
// `<seat>: launching`, rewritten in place while the seat advances, until its one final record.
// On a terminal the line is drawn before the seat's workspace is created and rewritten with a
// carriage return and a clear to the end of the line — never a cursor move to another line — and
// the final record ends with a newline. A redirected stdout receives only the final records, one
// newline-terminated line per seat, in file order: no provisional text, no carriage return, no
// escape sequence. Everything else a run says — refusals, notes, the timeout's last reading, what
// the owner does next — is on stderr, after the record it belongs to.
//
// The record is the unit the pause builds on: a pause at a dialog is a `waiting for owner`
// record, and `waiting` draws it provisionally while the prompt is open — replaced in place when
// the classification changes, and left without a newline, so the seat still ends with exactly one
// final record.
//
// The writer cleans every string it writes — one physical line per field and per detail line
// (`plainLine`: the one cleaning with the line breaks folded) — and it is the boundary between
// whatever a caller built — a seat name, a live stage word, a reason read off a screen — and the
// terminal. `cleanRecord` is that cleaning for a whole record, so a caller can clean once and
// hand the same words to the log and the writer both.

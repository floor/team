 * left by a killed run is taken over by the next one (`seat-lock.ts`). The name is a leading
 * dot, so it can never be a seat name (`file/sections/seats.ts`) and can never collide with a
 * seat's own lock.
 *
 * The order against the per-seat locks is one way only — run lock, then seat lock. A command
 * takes the run lock never while holding a seat lock.

// name or a record's reason would move the cursor, clear the screen, or restyle everything after
// it, and an invisible format character would display other words than the string holds, or hide
// them. `plainText` is the one cleaning: escape sequences removed whole, control characters and
// the invisible format characters gone, the line breaks kept. `plainLine` is it with the line
// breaks folded — one line in, one line out — for the fields and the detail lines a record
// writer says. `plainPaneText` is `plainText` plus the per-line cut the pane excerpts use.

/** A string as it is safe to print: every escape sequence is removed whole — a CSI's private
 *  parameters among them, and the payload of a string sequence (OSC, DCS, APC, PM, SOS),
 *  whichever introducer and terminator are mixed, 7-bit `ESC x` or its one-byte C1 form, `ESC \`
 *  or C1 ST, or BEL to close an OSC; one left unterminated goes to the end of the text — and the
 *  characters the rule below names. The line breaks are kept: a multi-line detail stays
 *  multi-line.
 *
 *  The rule, so that no list of characters is the definition and no code point has to be
 *  re-audited into it: every C0 and C1 control character, every character of Unicode category
 *  Cf, Zl and Zp, and the whole tag block U+E0000–U+E007F is removed or folded. LF is the fold
 *  target, not a removal: the line and paragraph separators U+2028 (Zl) and U+2029 (Zp) become
 *  LF on the spot, so `plainLine` folds any of the three exactly as it folds a line feed, and a
 *  field's bytes are the same wherever they are shown or written.
 *  - The variation selectors stay, on purpose: U+FE00–U+FE0F and U+E0100–U+E01EF only choose how
 *    the character before them is drawn — they never show other words than the string holds — so
 *    they are carried through whatever a category table says (both runtimes here report U+FE0E,
 *    U+FE0F and U+E0100 `Cf` false and `Mn` true).
 *  - The tag block is removed whole because a category test alone would leave its edges:
 *    U+E0000 and U+E001F are unassigned, not `Cf`.
 *  - U+200D is not an exception: removing it splits an emoji joined with it into the characters
 *    the string actually holds — the joiner is invisible, the parts are what the string says.
 *    Accepted.
 *
 *  The C0/C1 line is the rule read directly: every C0 (U+0000–U+001F) and C1 (U+007F–U+009F)
 *  control goes, LF alone left for the fold. */

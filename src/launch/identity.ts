// a command line, an argument or an environment can hold secrets, and none is ever stored,
// logged or printed.
//
// One recorded shell pid tells the two failures apart: a pane whose shell is still the recorded
// one but whose CLI is gone was restarted in place; a pane whose shell is another process was
// restored by something that started both again. Several CLI pids cover a CLI that shows a
// helper process beside it: the seat is the seat while any one of them is still in front.

// - `gone`: the pane's own shell is in front and no CLI is: the seat is not running.
// - `replaced`: a process is in front that the record does not name: not the one team launched.
// - `unknown`: herdr can't tell — no record, no reading, no foreground process. Treated exactly
//   as a seat without a record (today's behaviour): a relaunch would record nothing either, so
//   there is no repair to make.

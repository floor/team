// A launch line is not shell-parsed: `team` splits it the way it always has, on whitespace, and
// examines the program — its first word that is not a variable assignment — and the arguments
// written `./…`, `../…` or `~/…`. A relative path in a launch line means one thing: a command line
// run in the folder the seat starts in, which `team` does not rewrite. A seat that works in
// worktrees starts in the lobby, beside the worktrees, not in the project root, so `../tools/x.sh`
// that a hand run in the root finds may resolve nowhere from the lobby. The check refuses only
// what it has proved can't run: a first word a shell would act on — `$`, backticks, a backslash,
// a glob, `~user`, an unmatched or partly quoted word — leaves the line unread, and a relative
// argument is a note: its meaning is not knowable in general and the command may create the path
// it names. The one refusable relative argument is a shell's own script path, where the shell
// exits 127 without starting anything. `~/…` stands for the pane
// shell's own home, so it is looked for there: captured on herdr 0.7.1, typing
// `if [ ~ = "$HOME" ]; then echo "tilde-equals-home probe=tilde-expanded-ok"; fi` into a pane
// printed `tilde-equals-home probe=tilde-expanded-ok`, and `ls -d ~` ran.

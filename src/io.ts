 *  takes it once at its entry and writes everything else through it, so nothing that command
 *  writes reaches a terminal uncleaned, whoever built the text.
 *
 *  The one writer that keeps the raw sinks is the progress writer: it draws its own control
 *  bytes (on a TTY a `\r\x1b[K` before each in-place rewrite), and cleaning would strip them;
 *  its text it cleans itself, field by field, before it composes those bytes. The record's
 *  fields are cleaned through `plainLine` either way, so the two never disagree about text.

 *  cleaned at a call site and again here is, in effect, cleaned once. */

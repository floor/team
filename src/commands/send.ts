       team send --list [--json]

Writes one message to one seat over the cross-session message socket — the channel a
Claude Code session exposes, never typing into its pane. Only the owner, or the
orchestrator from its own seat, may call it; a worker seat may not. --list sends nothing:
it prints the file's seats and needs no caller check.

The outcome is one of five, and none of them is silent:
  delivered    the seat's socket took the frame (exit 0)
  answered     --wait: the seat's reply came back; the reply follows on stdout (exit 0)
  timeout      --wait: delivered, but no reply within the window (exit 1)
  unreachable  that socket could not take it (exit 1): the session is not running, no
               live agent carries the seat's name, no socket file was found for its
               pane's processes, or the connection would not take the frame
  refused      nothing was sent (exit 1): not a declared seat, a channel this build
               does not carry yet, a message over the socket's measured limit, a reply
               listener that could not be opened, or a caller that may not send

The send is one frame with no acknowledgement: this channel reports nothing back, so
"delivered" means the socket accepted the frame — the receiving session's own inbound
policy decides when it surfaces. --wait blocks for the seat's reply, listening at this
process's own <sockets dir>/<pid>.sock — the address the receiving session answers to —
for --timeout seconds (default 120; --timeout is only meaningful with --wait). --json
prints one result document instead of the lines: {seat, status, exit, reply?, error?,
ids}. --file reads the body from a file instead of the one <message> argument.

Not in this build, and marked TODO where they will land: delivery to a native-CLI seat
(the daemon) and broadcast.

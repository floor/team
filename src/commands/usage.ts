 * way the design note rules (§ 2.1-§ 2.3). Read-only: it writes nothing anywhere, not even the
 * `last_valid` copy `currentTeam` keeps, and it never answers from that copy when the file
 * breaks. Any caller may run it, from any folder, and a run outside every project is no refusal:
 * `mine` is null and the whole report reads restricted. The caller is placed once (`viewFor`,
 * `caller.ts`): the owner at a terminal reads the full view — every team named, every root
 * carried, every team's own rows — and everyone else, the restricted view, whose shape is the one
 * closed allow-list `reportOf` builds before either renderer: no other team's name or root, no
 * per-team row but the caller's own, no path a state read produced, another team's problem as a
 * fixed counted sentence (`ANON`). The command itself resolves nothing twice: `mine` is the one
 * resolution, the loader's own message is a note for the owner and a fixed sentence for anyone
 * else (`noticeOf`, `errorNote`), and the only refusal beside the invocation is the stores folder
 * itself unreadable (`usage.store`, § 2.4). Exit 0 whatever the figures.

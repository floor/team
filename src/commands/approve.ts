 * nothing (runs: cooked, `9\n` queued → read returns `9\n`, a second read is EAGAIN — the line
 * is gone; cooked, `9` queued with no Enter → EAGAIN, because cooked mode holds no partial
 * line, so a half-typed line is invisible to this check and to any question alike; raw mode
 * (`stty raw`), where the terminal hands keystrokes over at once, makes the same `9` readable
 * → `waiting`). EAGAIN is `empty`. A 0-byte read — the terminal gone — and every other
 * failure, a device that cannot be found or verified included, are `unreadable`: the caller
 * refuses rather than approves without having looked. What this cannot see is input that
 * arrives after the read and before the write; the docs say so in one sentence. The walk above

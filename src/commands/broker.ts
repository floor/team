// `team broker`: the one process that reads the tracker credential. The owner runs it, in a
// foreground terminal outside herdr, one per clone — a call placed as a seat, in a pane or under
// herdr at all is refused before the credential is read and before any bind. It refuses to start
// without the macOS Keychain facility or without an interactive run, because the credential's
// home is the owner's Keychain and the read is the owner's act. The key is read once, at start,
// into this process's memory only; it reaches
// exactly one place — the Authorization header of the tracker's single bounded read. The broker
// never puts its own credential, or the tracker's API access, into any field it returns: the
// answer holds the typed record, filtered by the team file's task policy before it is
// serialized. The broker runs as the same OS user as the seats: that is an integrity boundary,
// not an authenticity one, and the page says so. Nothing starts or restarts the broker.

and never crosses to a seat: the answer holds the typed record, filtered by the team file's

// resolved with `remember` false for every caller, nothing of the watch's pass, report, readings
// or nudge path is called, and the one screen reading (§3.3a) is read-only.
//
// The caller decides, not the flags. The walk classifies the caller before any target is opened,
// and a caller that does not pass as one of the three gets one fixed sentence and nothing else,
// whatever failed underneath — a loader error, a refused standing, herdr's silence, an aimed flag
// and every caller detail among them (the two-phase rule, §4).

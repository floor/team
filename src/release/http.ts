// The one network seam of `team release check`: a URL in, one HTTP attempt out. Every read the

// any kind. The single exception is the Linear read's POST, whose caller names the headers
// exactly (its media type and its one credential); the wiring adds nothing of its own in either
// case. It follows no redirect (a 3xx is the answer, and the checks read it as unknown), never
// reads a credential or a credential helper, and never touches git. The retry policy and the
// read/attempt caps live with the checks (src/release/checks.ts); here is only one attempt, with
// its timeout and its size limit.

 *  replacement character) — so the retry rule reads the status whatever the body; `timeout` and

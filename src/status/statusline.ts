 * Whether the seat's declared model could ever be read off its screen: `seatModel`'s question
 * asked of the model the file declares instead of the text the screen shows. The answer is
 * declared, not derived: each `status_model` rule states, in its `yields` list, the exact model
 * names it can spell, and in its `version_like` the version shapes it can spell them with, and a
 * test on the captured fixtures keeps every declared name and version honest against the real
 * reader, in both directions. Yes when some rule of the seat's profile lists exactly the seat's
 * model and, when the seat has a version, that version matches the rule's `version_like` —
 * nothing is built and no reader is run. A model no list names (another maker's, a made-up
 * family) is not readable, and a rule that declares nothing yields nothing. A seat it answers no
 * to is unread for as long as it runs — `status` prints its model `(unread)` with a note, and the
 * watch never reports a drift for it — so no launch-time finding may claim the running seat
 * checks it.

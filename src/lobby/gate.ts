 * mode under umask 022 and 077 alike — and nothing chmods it afterwards: the mode is checked
 * below and a wrong one is refused, never repaired, so no link swapped in after creation can
 * steer a mode change at a folder the gate did not create. The successful result's `path` is
 * the canonical path rebuilt from the components just `lstat`ed: the same string `realpath` of
 * the lobby returned. A read-only check of a lobby that is simply absent — including when
 * `~/.config` or `team` is not there yet — is `{ missing: true }`, not a failure.
 *
 * With `files`, the exact relative paths the profiles the tool ships declare, the
 * lobby's tree is closed around them: nothing undeclared may remain, and each declared file
 * that is there must be the running user's regular file, no link anywhere on its path. The
 * successful result records each one's full identity — device and inode, size, inode change
 * time and birth time — for the recheck, through `lstat` alone: the gate never opens a
 * declared file. Without `files` the lobby holds nothing but the seats, as it always has.

// The cross-session message socket, as a client.
//
// The listener is the one a Claude Code session exposes at `<tmp>/cc-socks/<pid>.sock`
// (`pid` is the session process). The team's own probe of that socket, on Claude Code
// 2.1.295 (2026-10-09; recorded outside this repository), measured: UTF-8 JSON lines, one
// frame per line, newline-terminated; a first-complete-line deadline of 30,000 ms; a buffer
// limit of 1,048,576 characters (1,048,577 `x` bytes made the receiver close); a
// `type:"user"` frame carrying `message:{role:"user",content:string}` is admitted; the
// sender's socket `recv` came back empty — there is no acknowledgement on the
// connection, so a frame the socket took is as far as a send can be proven. The
// receiving session's `crossSessionInbound` policy decides when the frame surfaces: the
// probe saw a standalone sender's message held as unidentified (`The sender did not
// attest its permission mode`) unless the seat was started with `accept`. The
// `ENOTSOCK` label in `reasonOf`, and the two socket tests in `test/send.test.ts`, are
// this build's own measured runs against a real listener.

# team

Set up and run a team of AI agents for your project. Agents propose, you decide.

`team` is a command-line tool: a project declares its team in `.agents/team.yaml` — the seats, the
model each one runs, the rules it works under, the folders it may touch — and the commands check
that file against the machine and start and watch the team. Nothing runs until you approve the
file on your machine. It runs the team in [herdr](https://herdr.dev), needs nothing else at
runtime (no dependencies), and Node 22 or later runs it.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g team
```

The launcher `@teamcli/cli` installs the same tool:

```sh
npm install -g @teamcli/cli
```

## Start

In your project's git repository, from the owner's terminal:

```sh
team init                # writes .agents/team.yaml: one seat, and comments to edit
team approve             # reads the file back for a last look, then records it on this machine
team doctor              # what this machine still needs
team up                  # starts the session and its seats
```

Edit `.agents/team.yaml` between `init` and `approve`: the comments it writes name every field, and
the file stays private to your clone (it goes in `.git/info/exclude`, never `.gitignore`).

## What it needs

- Node 22 or later, and [herdr](https://herdr.dev), the terminal multiplexer the team runs in.
- Each seat's CLI, installed and signed in: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or Antigravity. `team doctor`
  says what is missing; `team doctor --login` checks the sign-ins read-only.
- The owner's terminal, outside herdr, for `approve` and `up`: both read the processes above the
  call and refuse a seat — or an agent-run CLI — that makes it. That guards against a mistaken
  agent, not a hostile one; a seat that forges the owner's placement is a known limitation, being
  hardened.

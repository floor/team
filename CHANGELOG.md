## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-04

The first release: set up, change and watch a project's team of AI agents from one file,
`.agents/team.yaml`. Runs on Node 22 or later, with no runtime dependencies.

### Added

- The team file: a documented YAML subset with its own parser, validated field by field with line
  numbers, and a fictional example at `examples/team.yaml`. (#2, #11)
- `team init` and `team status`: write the skeleton file and keep it out of git through
  `.git/info/exclude`; print the file's seats against the running session, each difference with its
  repair; `--json` prints the same facts as one JSON document (`format: 1`) for scripts. (#3, #33)
- A seat whose own status line names another model than the file's is a status difference, with its
  repair; a model id the map doesn't know, or another maker's model run through Claude Code, is
  unread — a note, never a difference. (#30)
- `team approve`: record the file, its ceilings and its seats on this machine after a read-back and
  a typed seat count; `--show` prints the approved copy. (#4, #5)
- `team check`: check one commit, a range or a pull request body against the signature rule;
  forbidden lines and session links are refused by default; it runs on every pull request in this
  repository's CI, against the repository's own team file and the seats that sign its history.
  (#1, #8, #12)
- `team doctor`: check this machine for what the file needs — herdr, each CLI, login, launcher,
  model, watch heartbeat; `--login` checks read-only that each declared CLI is signed in, using each
  profile's login check, and answers no prompt. (#5, #33)
- `team watch`: report idle and blocked seats, unsent input and machine figures, and nudge the
  operator only into an empty idle prompt; `--no-nudge` and `--no-notify` turn those off. (#6, #7,
  #22)
- Linux: the caller check and the watch's load, memory and swap figures are read from `/proc`, so
  `team` answers there as on macOS. (#29)
- `team up` and `team down`: start and stop the session and its seats, each with its caller rule;
  staged launches, a wait for an empty idle prompt, trust and update screens read and never
  answered; `--dry-run` prints the plan and changes nothing. (#5, #13, #14)
- Launch profiles for `claude-code`, Codex, Antigravity and Cursor: approval flags added only at
  launch, rules delivered only into an empty idle prompt, screens read from recorded, sanitised
  fixtures; a Codex permission dialog is reported for its owner and never answered. (#16, #17,
  #18, #23, #24, #27)
- `team add` and `team remove`: start one declared or temporary seat; stop a seat, then take it out
  of the file — `--keep` leaves it stopped, `--abandon` is the owner's. (#19, #20)
- `team worktree new` and `team worktree remove`: create a task worktree from an up-to-date base, or
  remove its folder; a failed setup is kept and recorded, and the branch is never deleted. (#15)
- A README that covers the file by example and every command with who may run it. (#9)
- A page per command in `docs/commands`, every example run in CI. (#31)

// The paste guard, end to end: the BUILT command, under a real pty, as a caller the walk
// places as the owner.
//
// `team approve` refuses when a canonical-mode line is already queued on the terminal its own
// standard input is attached to — the rest of a pasted block, which must not be left to
// approve anything. The guard sits after the caller walk, so the proof needs an owner
// placement: a clean ancestry (CI's runner, or a launchd-parented run) with a terminal on
// stdin, which the pty gives. Where the suite runs inside an agent every pty child would be a
// stranger, so the placement is probed once at load and the end-to-end cases are SKIPPED
// there, with the reason printed — a stranger's refusal is never reported as a pass. The same
// file under `launchctl submit` is the macOS run quoted in the PR.
//
// Three topologies, because the guard must not read /dev/tty:
//  - stdin = the pty slave = the controlling terminal (pty.fork): the brief's case.
//  - stdin = the pty slave with NO controlling terminal (--no-ctty), where /dev/tty is not the
//    command's input at all. This is the topology the reviewed head fails in: a /dev/tty read
//    throws there, and a guard whose catch answers "nothing waiting" lets approve write.
// Both topologies are exercised with a line waiting and with nothing waiting, so a refusal
// cannot be a run that refuses everything, and an approval cannot be a run that never looked.

// The delegated `approve` and its self-escalation guard: the non-negotiable gate of this
// change. A delegate approves ordinary changes freely — the roster, launch lines, rules — and
// can never approve a change to its own authority. The guard is an allowlist, fail-closed:
// `rules` is the only owner section a delegate may move, every other one is refused by
// default — authority, money, the ceilings, identity, trust, the workspace — and so is any
// section the parser grows later, because the test is membership, not exclusion. Here the
// guard is the real one: gate-level scenes against `delegateGate` with only the reads a
// scratch test cannot make faked (the standing, the approved copy, herdr, the state, the
// placement), and end-to-end runs of `runApprove` over a real signed store in a scratch
// home — the real guard, the real key, the real log line.

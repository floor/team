// text and `--json` keep (no other team's name, root, seat or read, no location this machine
// derived, no path a state read produced), the full view's own shape, the anonymized note
// families with their counts, the store-level refusal, and the five droppable allow-list entries
// the brief lists — the team count, whose reading a machine line carries, the watch clause, the
// anonymized note counts, and how fine an age is — each with its own test below. Read-only
// throughout: nothing here writes, runs, reads a pane or opens a CLI session file.

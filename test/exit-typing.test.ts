  //   * the only choice row dropped: what is left — marked row, blank, footer — is exactly the
  //     clipped form a short pane draws, its marked row the same row, so it stays this dialog;
  //   * the footer dropped: no line of the screen carries a footer at all, and it reads
  //     `unknown`, a screen matching no shape — nothing sends a key on it;
  //   * the first row doubled: the copy above the block is a transcript row and the dialog under
  //     it is whole, the reading `claude-code-exit-question-below-quote.txt` pins as well.
  // Every row above the block is swept too, and no change to it reaches the reading: the block is

# Reporting a weakness

A weakness in TeamCLI — the `team` command of this repository — is reported in private,
through this repository's security advisories on GitHub: the repository's Security tab,
"Report a vulnerability". Please do not report one in a public issue, discussion or pull
request.

## What to include

- the version you run (`team --version`);
- your operating system;
- what you did, what happened, and what you expected instead;
- the smallest team file or commands that show it.

Please paste no secrets: never a key, a token or a private file.

## What we do

This is our commitment: we answer, we fix, and we say afterwards what it was, in the
release notes of the version that fixes it. We answer as soon as we can, and a report is
never ignored.

## Which versions get fixes

The latest release only.

## What is not a weakness in TeamCLI

- TeamCLI protects against an agent's mistake, not against a hostile program running as
  you: agents run as your user, and what you can read on your machine, they can read.
- What an agent's own program or its lab does with what it reads; whether a lab's model
  can be trusted; what a page an agent read told it to do.
- Keys and tokens your own shell exports are visible to every agent started from it.
- Several people sharing one machine, and a hosted TeamCLI: neither is supported.
- A weakness in herdr, in a lab's CLI, or in another tool belongs to that project: report
  it there.

A report that shows TeamCLI doing something its own documentation says it does not do is
in scope, whatever the list above says.
